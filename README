## Design Choices and Architectural Decisions
State Management

Used React's useState and useEffect for local state management
Implemented periodic score updates with setInterval
Created a flexible updateScores function that randomizes participant scores

## UI/UX Considerations

Utilized Framer Motion for smooth animations
Implemented position change indicators (up/down/stable)
Color-coded rows based on participant ranking
Added tooltips for additional context

## Performance Optimization

Memoized components where possible
Used layout animations for smooth transitions
Controlled re-renders with careful dependency management in useEffect

## Scalability

Used TypeScript interfaces for strong typing
Modular component structure
Easily extensible data model for participants

## Customization

Modify initialParticipants in Leaderboard.tsx to change initial data
Adjust update interval in useEffect hook
Customize color schemes and styling in Tailwind classes
